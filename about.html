       <h1>About Kathryn McGregor</h1>
       <a href="index.html"> Homepage</a> 
       <br>
       <p>I am currently a senior at Hershey High School.<br>
            I am most interested in pursuing an eductaion in<br>
            computer science after I graduate.<br>
       </p>
       <br>
       <p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
       <p>Throughout my time in high school I have had many amazing<br>
           experiences through a variety of clubs and activities. I <br> 
           was a memeber of the marching band as well as the indoor<br> 
           color guard all four years of highschool. During my junior<br>
           and senior years I was one of the color guard section leaders<br> 
           as well as one of the indoor team captains.<br>
       </p>

       <p>Since fourth grade I have played viola in the school orchestra.<br>
            I have loved playing the instrument since I began and was a part<br>
            of auditioned orchestra during my sophomore, junior, and senior years.<br>
            During my freshman year I also was given the opportunity to play viola<br>
            in the pit for our spring musical.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, our school started a LINK program during my junior year.<br>
            After being selected as a Link Crew Leader I was tasked with working closely<br>
            with a group of incoming freshamn to help make their transition to<br>
            highschool sooner. This gave me a deeper appreciation for the positive<br>
            culture at my school as well as the compassion and patience of my peers that<br>
            I worled alongside.<br>
